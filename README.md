**PROJECT SCOPE**: Development of a Spam Detection System classifying Spam/Ham Emails. This is a machine learning-based project for detecting spam messages in emails or text communications. This repository implements various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms to identify and filter out spam efficiently. Ideal for those interested in applying ML to real-world text analysis and cybersecurity challenges.

**PROJECT RESULTS**:
- Dataset Pre-Processing and Tokenization Step.
- Data Padding in order to Standardize all the Emails.
- BiDirectional LSTM Model Development to detect Spam Emails.
